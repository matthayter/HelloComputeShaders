A few files to demonstrate compute shaders in Unity.

Branches:

- hello-world: The minimal. A compute shader calculates a moving position for an object and a surface shader draws a sphere based on the output of the compute shader.
- 2-multi-object: As above, but with multiple spheres moving at different speeds.
- 3-flocking: A basic flocking implementation in the compute shader, and the surface shader rotates the objects to face in the direction of travel.
